This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in C related to pointer arithmetic and memory management. The `bug.c` file contains code that exhibits the error, while `bugSolution.c` shows the corrected version. This example highlights the potential for subtle bugs when working with pointers in C and emphasizes the importance of careful memory management and pointer initialization.  The issue showcases how seemingly simple pointer operations can lead to unexpected outcomes.  Pay close attention to memory allocation and pointer validity to avoid similar issues.
